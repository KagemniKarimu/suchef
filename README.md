## Overview

`suchef` is a culinary intelligence, designed to bring a rich, prosocial, tutor-like experience to the practice of digitally assisted cooking. The name `suchef` comes from a simple pun, combining the common cuisinary term of art "sous-chef" for an assistant chef with Linux's famous `sudo` command that elevates priveleges.  The goal of `suchef` is to bring a super user experience to kitchen cooking by using AI insights.

## Architecture

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). The core functionality uses [reachat](https://reachat.dev/) to provide a pre-built user interface and unique chat experience. The prototype website is hosted on Vercel, for ease of access and ease of deployment.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
